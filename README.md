# WebCheatMenu
An site that i used for config an cheat for a game ex: valorant, fortnite, cs2...

* That was my first experience in front-end (HTML + JS + CSS)
* I did it about 1y+ ago
* I made about 2/3 other new menus using NextJS + Tailwind CSS + typescript (and all they is very very better than this one...but i want to keep they private)

Maybe you can use this project to paste? Learn something? Just inspiration? i dont know, it depends on you.
